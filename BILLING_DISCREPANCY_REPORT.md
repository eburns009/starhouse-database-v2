## Root Cause Analysis

This appears to be a **systematic integration failure** between Kajabi and PayPal:

1. **Cancellation in Kajabi does not trigger cancellation in PayPal**
2. **PayPal subscription IDs remain active** despite Kajabi showing "canceled"
3. **Customers continue to be charged** without receiving services
4. **Pattern spans 2+ years** (Anthony Smith case), indicating long-standing issue

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate:** Cancel all 4 PayPal subscriptions manually:
   - I-3EGRVB085SRA (Anthony Smith)
   - I-A23T0X7HBSCG (Chris Loving-Campos)
   - I-HPW0LXHEETMU (Dionisia Hatzis)
   - I-P7B0N76MNKS6 (Hildy Kane)

2. **Refunds:** Process full refunds totaling $990.00

3. **System Fix:** Review and fix Kajabi-PayPal integration to ensure cancellations sync

4. **Audit:** Check all other "canceled" Kajabi subscriptions to identify additional affected customers
